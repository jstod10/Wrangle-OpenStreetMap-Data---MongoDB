Source Map:

https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=11/36.1612/-115.3510

The map boundaries of the chosen selection are as follows:
36.1595
-115.3729
35.9791
-115.2425

Reasons for Choosing This Location:

  I have been living in Las Vegas a little over 13 years.  For the last 12 years, I have lived in the Southwest area of the Las Vegas Valley.  This general area is represented by the map selection I used for this exercise. 
	
  I chose this location because I am very familiar with it and have been able to travel around this area extensively.  I wanted to bring life experiences and knowledge of the location to the table so that I could add another layer of auditing verification to my subsequent explorations.  In addition, I also sought to gain a greater understanding of the data behind the location in which I live.
